## Abstract
Numba is a Just-In-Time (meaning your code is compiled during execution rather than before) Python compiler that works hand-in-hand with NumPy to optimize code that focuses on mathematical computations. It is primarily used in scientific and engineering applications to accelerate computational workloads, such as simulations, numerical solvers, and data analysis, by enabling high-performance execution of Python functions without requiring extensive rewrites or the more advanced debugging that come with using C/C++. Rather than a "middlewear" or standalone application, Numba functions as a programming tool meant to enhance your numerical code with minimal modifications. 

## Installation 
1. Using a development node of your choice on the HPCC, clone this repository using this command: `git clone (link)`.
2. Run the command `pip install numba` to get Numba downloaded!
